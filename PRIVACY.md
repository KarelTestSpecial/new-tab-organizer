# Privacy Policy for Custom Startpage

**Last updated:** 2025-08-24

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Custom Startpage" browser extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

This extension is designed with your privacy in mind. We believe that your data should be your own.

**This extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information or browsing activity.**

All the data you create and use within this extension, including your panel layouts, notes content, and settings, is stored locally on your own computer using your browser's built-in storage mechanisms.

## 2. Chrome Sync

The extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` to save your settings and panel data. This service is provided by your browser to sync your extension data across your own devices where you are logged into your Google account. This data is managed by Google according to their privacy policy and is not accessible by the developer of this extension.

## 3. Permissions

This extension requires the following permissions to function:

-   **`bookmarks`**: This permission is required to read your bookmarks. It is used solely to display your bookmark folders as panels on the startpage, as configured by you. The extension **never** modifies, deletes, or transmits your bookmark data.
-   **`storage`**: This permission is required to save your extension's settings and panel layout. As mentioned above, this data is stored locally and/or synced to your own Google account.
