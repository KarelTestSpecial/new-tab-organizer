# Privacy Policy for New Tab Organizer

**Last updated:** 2025-09-17

This Privacy Policy describes how the "New Tab Organizer" browser extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

This extension is designed with your privacy in mind. We believe that your data should be your own.

**This extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information or browsing activity.**

All the data you create and use within this extension, including your panel layouts, notes content, and settings, is stored locally on your own computer using your browser's built-in storage mechanisms.

## 2. Chrome Sync

The extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` to save your settings and panel data. This service is provided by your browser to sync your extension data across your own devices where you are logged into your Google account. This data is managed by Google according to their privacy policy and is not accessible by the developer of this extension.

## 3. Permissions

This extension requires the following permissions to function:


-   **`bookmarks`**: To read, display, create, edit, and organize your bookmarks. This permission is essential for the extension's core features, which include: displaying bookmarks in the sidebar, creating dedicated bookmark panels, and allowing you to manage your bookmarks (edit titles/URLs, delete, and move them) directly from the start page. Your bookmark data is not collected or shared.
-   **`storage`**: The extension requires storage permission to save the user's personalized layout and settings. This includes the state of their panels (position, content, titles) and their chosen preferences (like theme). This allows the user's custom startpage to persist between sessions and sync across their devices via their own Google account. No data is collected by or sent to the developer.
-   **`tabs`**: This permission is used to manage tabs for the extension's core navigation features. This includes: 1. Opening your bookmarks in a new tab when you click them. 2. Opening the browser's history page from the sidebar link. 3. Switching between the extension's different views (1, 2, 3) without opening duplicate tabs. This permission is **not** used to read your browsing history or the content of other tabs.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
